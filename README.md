# Topic-Classification-for-Newsgroup-Posts

The problem at hand is to develop a robust text classification model that can accurately 
categorize newsgroup posts into one of the predefined 20 topics. This task involves training a 
machine learning model to automatically assign a category label to a given newsgroup post based 
on its content.

The primary objective is to build a text classification system that generalizes well to 
unseen data and can handle the inherent challenges of diverse writing styles, language nuances, 
and varying lengths of documents within the newsgroups. The project involves preprocessing the raw text data, exploring feature extraction techniques, and implementing machine 
learning algorithms, potentially utilizing deep learning models for enhanced performance.
